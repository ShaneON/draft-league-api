##Fantasy Draft Api
This is the back end of a web application I am working on for my draft fantasy football league.
The idea is to have a central web app that the members can use to set up and pick their squads,
transfer players between each other, see the current league table standings etc...

The scores are pulled weekly from the official fantasy football api and saved to the database.
I am using java spring boot to build the application and mysql for the DB.
